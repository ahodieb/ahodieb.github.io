      <description>The RaspberryPi Pico was released earlier this year and I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen this much hype since the Arduino or the original RaspberryPi. It looked good, and it is very cheap (you can get one for less than 4Â£) so i got one to play around.
Why am i writing this ? There are plenty of good tutorials, examples, and books for the RaspberryPi Pico, so anything i write about here is most likely available somewhere else.</description>

      <description>I have accumulated a lot of random ideas that i want to transcribe and in doing so organize them into into coherent thoughts. So i decided to start a blog.
After lots of yak shaving and messing around with static site generators i decided to just get started with my first post, the reasoning is once the first one is out there the next ones will be easier.So to bypass this mental block, i&amp;rsquo;ll just dump some ideas i want to write about.</description>
