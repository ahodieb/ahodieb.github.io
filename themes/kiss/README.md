# Theme

This is a customized fork of [kiss theme](https://github.com/ribice/kiss). which is a form of [Hemingway theme](https://github.com/tanksuzuki/hemingway).
It is only intended for my personal use, anyone is welcome to fork and use it but probably better of using [kiss](https://github.com/ribice/kiss).
